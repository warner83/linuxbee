== XBEE Driver ==

This is a Linux kernel driver that allows you to use a Digi Xbee module in API
mode through a network interface. It uses a line discipline to talk to the
module through the serial port. The adaptation of Zigbee PAN to IP LAN is done
by adding an IP broadcast header to all incoming packets, and using the first 8
bytes of outgoing packets as the destination 802.15.4 hardware address. A
utility daemon is provided to setup the serial port's baud rate and other
parameters, and to attach the line discipline once loaded into the running
kernel.

To build:
- Change KERNELDIR in Makefile to the location of your kernel tree
- Change CC in Makefile to the gcc [cross-]compiler for your system
- make

To use:
- insmod n_xbee.ko
- Run ldisc_daemon with the serial port and baud rate of the Xbee module to attach
the line discipline to the serial port. It will automatically fork into the background.
- Configure the network interface (xbee0) with ifconfig
